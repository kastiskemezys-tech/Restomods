    <h1>Re-Engineered Range Rover Classic</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      Every Kastis KR Series begins with an original Range Rover Classic — stripped to bare metal,
      re-engineered from the ground up, and rebuilt to a standard the factory never imagined.
    </p>
    <p class="lede">
      Small production. Obsessive standards. Each vehicle is a singular commission,
      shaped around its owner and built entirely in our Kaunas workshop.

    <h2>The Range Rover Classic for Today</h2>
    <p class="lede" style="margin-top:16px">
      We take every proven strength of the original and elevate it — stronger, lighter, more refined.
      Nothing is left untouched.
    </p>

    <div class="editorial-grid">
      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Body &amp; Chassis</h3>
        <p>
          Each chassis is fully stripped, inspected, and zinc-coated for corrosion resistance
          that will outlast the original by decades. Aluminium body panels are hand-finished
          and fitted with modern tolerances while preserving the Classic's iconic silhouette.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Paintwork</h3>
        <p>
          Multi-stage paint processes using contemporary automotive finishes deliver depth
          and durability far beyond period standards. Every panel is prepared by hand,
          primed, and finished to concours quality before final assembly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Engines</h3>
        <p>
          A choice of fully rebuilt V8 petrol or modern diesel powertrains, each tuned
          for refined power delivery and long-distance reliability. Every engine is
          dynamometer-tested and matched to upgraded cooling and exhaust systems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Suspension</h3>
        <p>
          Upgraded coil-sprung suspension with adjustable dampers replaces the original setup,
          transforming on-road composure without sacrificing the go-anywhere capability
          that defined the Range Rover from the start.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Brakes</h3>
        <p>
          Four-piston calipers and ventilated discs at every corner provide stopping power
          matched to the increased performance. Braided lines and modern fluid ensure
          consistent, fade-free braking in all conditions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="editorial-block">
        <h3>Interiors</h3>
        <p>
          Full leather hides, machined aluminium details, and bespoke instrumentation
          replace the original interior entirely. Every surface is considered — from
          hand-stitched headlinings to modern climate control concealed within period-correct forms.

    <p class="kicker">Origin</p>
    <h2>Made in Lithuania</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:20px; color:var(--muted); line-height:1.7">
      Kastis was founded on a simple premise: the Range Rover Classic is one of the finest
      shapes in automotive history, and it deserves engineering to match. Our workshop sits
      in Kaunas — Lithuania's second city and a quiet centre of precision manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p style="color:var(--muted); line-height:1.7">
      Every KR Series vehicle is built by a single team, start to finish. We don't batch-produce.
      We don't outsource structural work. Chassis fabrication, paint, mechanical assembly,
      and interior trim happen under one roof, overseen by the same hands.
    </p>
    <p style="color:var(--muted); line-height:1.7">
      Our standards are borrowed from aerospace and motorsport: documented torque values,
      photographed assembly stages, and a final inspection process that takes longer than
      most workshops spend on an entire service. We build slowly because there is no shortcut
      to getting it right.
    </p>
    <p style="color:var(--muted); line-height:1.7">
      The result is a vehicle that looks period-correct at a glance but reveals its true nature
      the moment you drive it — composed, powerful, and built to be used every day,
      not stored behind glass.
